# File Path: shared/data/navigation.yaml
# Version: 1.1.0
# Description: Defines the navigation structure for the application. Mirrors navData.json but written in YAML for backend usage.
# Key Features:
# - Defines a hierarchical navigation structure with menu items and sub-items.
# - Includes metadata like icons and subtitles for frontend rendering.
# - Validated against navigation.schema.json to ensure correct structure.
# How-To Guide:
# 1. Place this file under shared/data.
# 2. Ensure navigation.schema.json is in shared/schemas.
# 3. Backend will parse this YAML and expose it via /api/navigation/yaml.
# 4. Frontend MegaMenu fetches the JSON representation.
# Change Log:
# - 1.1.0 (2025-09-13): Changed `href` to `url` to align with updated schema.
# - 1.0.0 (2025-09-13): Initial navigation structure defined.
